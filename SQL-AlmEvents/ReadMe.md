###Description
This is the alarms and events log for Rockwell Factory Talk products.

**See References for source of information.  Almost all text directly from provided Help files.**
&copy;Rockwell Automation

- **Table - FTAEInstance** - metadata for this Alarm and Events database
- **View - ConditionEvent** - Includes any event associated with a change in the state of an alarm. For example, a condition-related event is triggered when an alarm condition changes to In Alarm, Acknowledged, Return to Normal, or Disabled.
- **View - SimpleEvent** - Includes any event describing a simple occurrence in the system. Example: failure to access a computer or device.
- **View - TrackingEvent** - Includes any event that tracks changes made to the system over time. Examples: an event describing the acknowledgment of an alarm by an operator, or the modification of a tag value by an operator.
- **View - AllEvents** - Includes all of the historical alarm and event data from the SimpleEvent, ConditionEvent, and TrackingEvent views into a single view. The FactoryTalk Alarm and Event Log Viewer extracts historical alarm and event data from the AllEvents view.

|EventAssociationId| FTUID| The EventId associated with the current event. Use this field to query for all of the events related to a given instance of an alarm and compute associated information (for example, the length of time that an item was active or active and unacknowledged).  As a given alarm instance changes state, this ID value will remain constant. For example, when an alarm becomes active, it will be assigned an ID value; when the alarm is acknowledged or returns to normal, that same ID value continues to be logged. Additionally, the same ID will be used for multiple conditions of a level alarm (for example, the HI and HIHI alarms will use the same ID value since the level alarm does not return to normal when going from the HI to HIHI states).| B281E097-5B7E-4167-A24B-C33BBE412C35|

As a given alarm instance changes state, this ID value will remain constant. For example, when an alarm becomes active, it will be assigned an ID value; when the alarm is acknowledged or returns to normal, that same ID value continues to be logged. Additionally, the same ID will be used for multiple conditions of a level alarm (for example, the HI and HIHI alarms will use the same ID value since the level alarm does not return to normal when going from the HI to HIHI states).| B281E097-5B7E-4167-A24B-C33BBE412C35|

###Extended Quality Values
The following table describes quality values (in addition to those provided by the OPC Historical Data Access specification) that are supported by FactoryTalk Alarms and Events.
    
|Quality Value (Decimal)|Display String| Description|
 |---|---|---|
|192| Good Quality - Non-specific| The quality of the value is good. There are no special conditions.|
|216| Good Quality - Local Override| The value has been overridden. Typically, this indicates that the input has been disconnected and a manually entered value has been forced.|
|00 | Bad Quality - Non-specific| The value is bad, but no specific reason is known.|
|65536| Bad Quality - Alarm input quality is bad| The alarm instruction input fault has been set to true.|
|4 | Bad Quality - Configuration Error| There is some server-specific problem with the configuration. For example, the item in question has been deleted from the configuration.|
|1048580| Bad Quality - Severity value is out of valid range (1-1000)| The severity of the alarm condition has been set to an invalid value.|
|1114116| Bad Quality - Overlapping threshold limits| A limit value of a level alarm has been set to a value that overlaps another limit.|
|1179652| Bad Quality - Deadband must be greater than or equal to zero| The deadband of a level alarm has been set to a negative value.|
|1245188| Bad Quality - Rate of change positive limit must be greater than or equal to zero| The positive limit of a rate of change alarm has been set to a negative value.|
|1310724| Bad Quality - Rate of change negative limit must be greater than or equal to zero| The negative limit of a rate of change alarm has been set to a negative value.|
|1376260| Bad Quality - Rate of change period must be greater than or equal to zero| The rate of change period has been set to a negative value.|
|1441796| Bad Quality - The alarm has been deleted| The alarm has been deleted from a controller via an online edit.|
|8| Bad Quality - Not Connected| The input is required to be logically connected, but it is not. This quality may reflect that no value is available at this time (for example, the value may have not been provided by the data source).|
|12 | Bad Quality - Device Failure| A device failure has been detected.|
|16 | Bad Quality - Sensor Failure| A sensor failure had been detected. Note that the Limit field can provide additional diagnostic information in some situations.|
|20| Bad Quality - Last Known Value| Communications have failed. However, the last known value is available. Note that the age of the value may be determined from the TIMESTAMP in the OPCITEMSTATE.|
|2162708| Bad Quality - Connection to controller has been lost| The connection to the controller has been lost.|
|2228244| Bad Quality - A program download is in progress| A program download is in progress.|
|2293780| Bad Quality - Non-Recoverable Program Fault has occurred in controller| A Major Non-Recoverable program fault has occurred.|
|24| Bad Quality - Communication Failure| Communications have failed. There is no last known value available.|
|28| Bad Quality - Out of Service| The block is off scan or otherwise locked. This quality is also used when the active state of the item or the group containing the item is InActive.|
|2097180| Bad Quality - Unable to subscribe to alarms from controller| If after connecting to a controller, RSLinx Enterprise cannot subscribe to alarms contained in the controller (for example, create the notify object) or can create the notify object, but only succeeds in subscribing to a subset of the total alarms.|
|32| Bad Quality - Waiting for initial data| After items are added to a group, it may take some time for the server to actually obtain values for these items. In such cases, the client might perform a read (from cache) or establish a connection point-based subscription and/or execute a refresh on such a subscription before the values are available. This sub-status is only available from OPC DA 3.0 or newer servers.|
|64| Uncertain Quality - Non-specific| The value is uncertain, but no specific reason is known.|
|68 | Uncertain Quality - Last Usable Value| The entity that was writing this value has stopped doing so. The returned value should be regarded as delayed or stale. Note that this differs from a BAD value with sub status 5 (Last Known Value). That status is associated specifically with a detectable communications error on a fetched value. This error is associated with the failure of some external source to put something into the value within an acceptable period of time. Note that the age of the value can be determined from the TIMESTAMP in OPCITEMSTATE.|
|2424900| Uncertain Quality - Mode of controller has been changed to Program.| The controller is in Program mode.|
|2359364| Uncertain Quality - Major Program Fault has occurred in controller| A Major Recoverable program fault has occurred.|
|80| Uncertain Quality - Sensor Not Accurate| Either the value has pegged at one of the sensor limits (in which case the Limit field should be set to 1 or 2) or the sensor is otherwise known to be out of calibration via some form of internal diagnostics (in which case the Limit field should be 0).|
|84 | Uncertain Quality - Engineering Units Exceeded| The returned value is outside the limits defined for this parameter. Note that in this case (per the Fieldbus Specification), the Limit field indicates which limit has been exceeded but does not necessarily imply that the value cannot move farther out of range.|
|88| Uncertain Quality - Sub-Normal| The value is derived from multiple sources and has less than the required number of good sources.|
